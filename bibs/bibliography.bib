  abstract  = {Multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) is a popular method for document classification due to its computational efficiency and relatively good predictive performance. It has recently been established that predictive performance can be improved further by appropriate data transformations [1,2]. In this paper we present another transformation that is designed to combat a potential problem with the application of MNB to unbalanced datasets. We propose an appropriate correction by adjusting attribute priors. This correction can be implemented as another data normalization step, and we show that it can significantly improve the area under the ROC curve. We also show that the modified version of MNB is very closely related to the simple centroid-based classifier and compare the two methods empirically.},

Processing biomedical and clinical text is a critically important application area of natural language processing, for which there are few robust, practical, publicly available models. This paper describes scispaCy, a new Python library and models for practical biomedical/scientific text processing, which heavily leverages the spaCy library. We detail the performance of two packages of models released in scispaCy and demonstrate their robustness on several tasks and datasets. Models and code are available at https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/.}
